## Short description

FreeShow is a free and open-source presentation program that makes it easy to show text on a big screen. It supports stage display, remote control, media, and many other advanced features. It is open-sourced meaning anyone can contribute.

FreeShow exists because the creator found that other simular programs was either expensive or complex to use. He wanted to create a program that was easy to use and affordable for everyone, from small churches to large venues. FreeShow is now used by people all over the world.

## Support us

The only reason this program is free is because of the generous support from users. If you want to support us to keep this free, please head over to [Live Church Solutions](https://livecs.org/partner). Thank you so much!
