## Short description

FreeShow is a free and open-source presentation program that makes it easy to show text on a big screen. It supports stage display, remote control, media, and many other advanced features. It is open-sourced meaning anyone can contribute.

I created FreeShow because other simular programs I tried was expensive or complex to use. I wanted to create a program that was easy to use and affordable for everyone, from small churches to large venues. FreeShow is now used by people all over the world.

## Donate?

I've put a lot of time and effort into developing FreeShow, and I'm passionate about continuing to develop it. If you would like to help me make FreeShow even better, a donation would be greatly appreciated.
